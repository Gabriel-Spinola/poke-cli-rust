# Rust version of [PokeGelo-CLI](https://github.com/Gabriel-Spinola/PokeGelo-CLI)
PokeGelo-CLI is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to simplify sending HTTP requests, making it easier and more intuitive compared to using curl. With PokeGelo-CLI, you can send HTTP requests by providing a JSON file containing the request and its body. This tool is especially useful for testing APIs, debugging, and automating HTTP requests.
